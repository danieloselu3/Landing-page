        <p>Ryan Reynold’s smart-talking antihero makes a profanely amusing addition to<br> the X-Men universe.<br>
           Mark Kermode .<b> The Guardian</b></p>

        <p>Deadpool is going to endear a whole new audience to the vivid and weird<br> character, while once again demonstrating the tremendous opportunity for<br> variety in the comic book movie genre.<br>
           Eric Eisenberg·<b>Cinemablend</b></p>

        <p>Still, Deadpool is party time for action junkies and Reynolds may just have<br> found the role that makes his career. Full review<br>

        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <p>
            There’s a lot of weird, cool stuff about Deadpool that makes him stand out from<br> your usual anti-heroic superhero, but one element that they’re going to have to<br> rein in is the violence. He is, after all, a brutal killer, and one thing that<br> has fans ruffled already is that Deadpool is reported to be PG-13. Many worry<br> that these constraints will hamstring what the movie can and can’t do, and you<br> better believe fans are going to be watching Miller, Reynolds, and company like<br> a hawk for any sign of trouble.<br>
